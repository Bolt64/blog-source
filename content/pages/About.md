 I am Sayantan Khan, a graduate student in Mathematics at the University of Michigan (and previously
 an undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science).  This website contains accounts of things I'm
 currently working on, along with details of some of my past work, both in pure mathematics, as well
 as other areas. I also maintain a [homepage](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~saykhan/) on the
 umich.edu domain.

### Quick links

These are some articles and notes I have written in the past which I'm too lazy to rewrite on my
blog. My [university homepage](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~saykhan/#notes) has a more up to date
list of articles.

- [Summary](pdfs/thesis_summary/thesis-summary.pdf) of my undergraduate final year project
which dealt with the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds.
- [Notes](pdfs/ggd_notes/spherical_geometry.pdf) on spherical geometry I took
at GGD 2017.
- [Article](pdfs/articles/technical_results.pdf) containing some
  technical results in homotopy theory.
- [Article](pdfs/articles/weyls.pdf) on Weyl's equidistribution theorem.
- [Article](pdfs/articles/roths.pdf) on Roth's theorem on existence of
  three-term arithmetic progressions in positive density subsets of natural
  numbers.
