 I am Sayantan Khan, an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Science 
 (and soon to be graduate student at University of Michigan),
 majoring in Mathematics. This website contains some things I occasionally
 write about, along with details of some of my
 past work, both in pure mathematics, as well as other areas.

### Quick links

These are some articles and notes I have written in the past which I'm too lazy to
rewrite on my blog.

- [Summary](pdfs/thesis_summary/thesis-summary.pdf) of my undergraduate final year project
which dealt with the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds.
- [Notes](pdfs/ggd_notes/spherical_geometry.pdf) on spherical geometry I took
at GGD 2017.
- [Article](pdfs/articles/technical_results.pdf) containing some 
  technical results in homotopy theory.
- [Article](pdfs/articles/weyls.pdf) on Weyl's equidistribution theorem.
- [Article](pdfs/articles/roths.pdf) on Roth's theorem on existence of
  three-term arithmetic progressions in positive density subsets of natural
  numbers.
