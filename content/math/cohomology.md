## Motivation for cohomology
In most introductory algebraic topology courses, cohomology is rather poorly
motivated. It's most commonly seen form in an algebraic topology course
is singular cohomology, which
arises as a the homology of the dual of the singular chain complex,
but that doesn't really tell you why it's of any more interest than singular
homology, aside from the fact that you get an additional cup product which
you did not have before. However, this approach obscures the geometric meaning
of cohomology. A much more intuitive introduction to cohomology turns out
to be De Rham cohomology, often encountered in introductory differential
geometry courses. Loosely speaking, De Rham cohomology measures
in how many different ways can a closed form fail to be exact.
Another cohomology theory we'll look at is sheaf cohomology. Loosely,
the cohomology of a sheaf measures how a certain functor $\Gamma$, which
we'll define later fails to be an exact functor. In both the cases, we'll interpret
